## Overview

In this challenge, I am required to code a ticket generator while following the designs provided for both Desktop and Mobile interfaces. I plan to use both Tailwind CSS and React JS to practice both frameworks. This project is currently in progress.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
